# Spot-A-Bee

This was a university client project from semester 2 of year 1, based on android. The client's goal for this project was to crowdsource the gathering of data on bees in Wales, but more specifically, where the bees are, and what plants are they gathering at. A user would use this app to take pictures of any bees that they may see, and hopefully, the app would be able to identify the flower in the picture (if the bee was on one). This data would then go back to the company so that they could start to implement measures to increase the local bee populations.

As a retrospective, we were not able to fully fill the client's request. The app could successfully identify 10 different flowers with above ~80% accuracy, but it was a longshot from the goal of all flowers, domestic and exotic. Additionally, the app did have some stability problems, some of which may still persist.

### And coding style tests

For code style, the group agreed to abide by CheckStyle's Oracle rules. There may have been a few violations, but by and large, we followed those rules exactly.
