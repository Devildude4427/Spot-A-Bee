# Spot-A-Bee
University Client Project, Team of 3


The client's goal for this project was to crowdsource the gathering of data on bees in Wales, but more specifically, where the bees are, and what plants are they gathering at. A user would use this app to take pictures of any bees that they may see, and hopefully, the app would be able to identify the flower in the picture (if the bee was on one). This data would then go back to the company so that they could start to implement measures to increase the local bee populations.
